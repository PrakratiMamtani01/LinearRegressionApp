# Insurance Application 🏠🚗
This application is regarding a healthcare insurance company who is looking to expand its market to vehicle insurance. I use the data provided by the company to see whether the current available data and survey results are in support of expanding into this new market. I perform data cleaning and analysis to identify the trends in the two markets and suggest whether it is feasible and right to use this strategy.
